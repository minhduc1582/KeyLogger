A hook is a point in the system message-handling mechanism where an application can install a subroutine
to monitor the message traffic in the system and process certain types of messages before they reach
the target window procedure.

Hook-Function:
LowLevelKeyboardProc	An application-defined or library-defined callback function used with the 
						SetWindowsHookEx function. The system calls this function every time a new keyboard 
						input event is about to be posted into a thread input queue.
						
CallNextHookEx			Passes the hook information to the next hook procedure in the current hook chain. 
						A hook procedure can call this function either before or after processing the hook information.

UnhookWindowsHookEx		Removes a hook procedure installed in a hook chain by the SetWindowsHookEx function.

SetWindowsHookEx		

GetModuleHandle			This function returns a module handle for the specified module if the file 
						has been mapped into the address space of the calling process.
